This was a challenging homework but given a short time frame, I wanted to still practice as much CSS without using ChatGPT so much but there were so many little changes that it became very hard not to. 
One of the biggest challenges was just having no way of figuring out a certain style without asking ChatGPT to identify what it was. For example, I didn't know what the little line underneath the Introduction and Common Octopus Species was so I had to ask certain things like that. In the end I stil didn't make it exactly as shown because it required the use of only underlining the first 3 letters which could only be accomplished using JS or changing the HTML. The HTML was anther big challenge especially in the Octopus quiz when trying to format the heading over the image even though the image came first in the html. I probably would have changed that if I was able to change the HTML to not go through the hassle, to which I still wasn't able to figure out. 
I think overall I did well and am proud of myself for how closely it resembles the original picture.
